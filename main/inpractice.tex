\chapter{Practical Experiments}
\label{ch:inpractice}

This chapter shows two experiments and results of advanced use of the Zone. The first realises an asynchronous sequence diagram of a parallel programm with dependencies. The second describe how to transparently instrument the third-party framework \vertx\ to realize a ``Zone-aware\vertx''.
