\label{ch:motiv}
To complete and give a clear idea of the problems I refer to, this chapter presents typical bugs encountered with asynchronous programming.

\section{Asynchronous Scope}

First problem with asynchronous execution is dealing with contextual values. Consider this simplistic code:

\begin{lstlisting}
Environment environment;

public void test() {
  environment = Environment.STANDARD;
  doStandardStuff();

  environment = Environment.CRITICAL;
  doCriticalStuff();

  environment = Environment.STANDARD;
  doStandardStuffAgain();
}
\end{lstlisting}

In synchronous code, there is no problem and everything runs with expected environment. Suppose now you need to improve performance. You change the method \lstinline{doCriticalStuff()} code to run asynchronously and forget to care about \lstinline{environment}. It's very likely that \lstinline{doCriticalStuff()} will run in a bad environment since it may execute \emph{after} \lstinline{environment} is modified.


This problem can be solved if we use a context persisting across asynchronous transitions to keep the environment value.


\section{Error Handling}

If the problem of asynchronous scope seems too basic to require attention, error handling already brings more challenge.

\begin{lstlisting}
public void test(int input) {
  
  try {
    heavyMathFunction(input);
  } catch (ArithmeticError e) {
    // handle error
  }

}
\end{lstlisting}

Again, as long as the code is synchronous there is no problem with the try-catch block. Once you decide to run asynchronously \lstinline{heavyMathFunction(int)} to avoid application freeze, the code may not handle (or even see) a runtime error.

A solution to this problem needs ways to keep error handler across asynchronous transitions or report asynchronous error to wrapping error handler.

\section{Error Tracing}

Suppose now asynchronous error are caught, debugging unexpected errors is still hard since the stack trace only goes back to the beginning of asynchronous execution. If the cause of the error precedes the asynchronous code submission, nothing can track it back.

\begin{lstlisting}
public void test() {

  int input1 = getInput1();
  startAsyncBatch(input1);
  // OK

  int input2 = getInput2();
  startAsyncBatch(input2);
  // OK

  int input3 = buggyGetInput();
  startAsyncBatch(input3);
  // bad implementation, gets bad input and throws
}
\end{lstlisting}

During execution, one error pops up, saying that the asynchronous batch got a bad input. It only indicates that somewhere in the code, \lstinline{startAsyncBatch(int)} was called with an invalid input. Imagine the stack trace going back before asynchronous execution. Finding the bug's origin is now a triviality.

To implement this, one could attribute a context value to each asynchronous execution containing the stack trace of the code that submitted the asynchronous code. Then on error handling, simply recover the asynchronous stack trace and add it to the caught error.

\section{Dependencies Tracking}

When asynchronous programs gets large, ordering and dependencies among tasks can be the source of complex bugs. To solve them, we cruelly lack a tool and a representation to visualize how an execution did really happen. This can be done at a very fine level, collecting the exact time at which each task gets started and finished. A more useful approach would be to collect only events when a task uses output of another task to create a dependency graph.

Implementing such collection would be very cumbersome: each asynchronous task needs modification. Missing one results in a bug. Modifying each task results in code pollution and duplication. Trying to simplify the implementation by hooking underlying structures (for instance Java threads) does not work, since no one directly uses threads in his application, but rely on more efficient executors, as thread pools. Threads are only dumb workers and have not the ability to look at different tasks they execute.

But a tool that achieve to automatically bind each asynchronous code to a context and capture transitions between these contexts can trivially collect dependencies among asynchronous tasks and export a graphical representation of it, under the form of a directed graph for example.

\section{Task Profiling}

There are plenty of features we can imagine to ease the understanding and analysis of asynchronous programs. For example, one may be interested in how many total time a job required to execute (by opposition to how many time elapsed between the begin and the end of that job).

\begin{lstlisting}
public void test() {
  
  ParallelTask myTask = new ParallelTask();

  long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

  myTask.start();
  myTask.join();

  long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
  long elasedTime = end - start;
  // does not consider parallel sub-tasks of myTask
  // elapsed time is not the total execution time
}
\end{lstlisting}

Using right tools and abstractions for asynchronous tracing can make it easy to implement such profiling. In this case, a context that can define the ``timer code'' in the form of a hook around asynchronous execution is the solutions. Then one simply has to wait for complete execution of all sub tasks, collect all individual times from all sub-contexts and sum them to get the precise result.
