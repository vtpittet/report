\section{Objectives}

Initial objectives were very specific and usage targeted. Final implementation pushes those primary features to the level of optional ones that can be implemented using Zone primitives.

\section{Asynchronous problematic}

Discuss evolution of point of interest through the research.

\begin{itemize}
\item First : how to implement an asynchronous context with some hooks
\item Final : the real need is an uniform and general behaviour on synchronous and asynchronous transition on which one can rely to implement contextual behavior.
\end{itemize}
