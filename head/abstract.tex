%purpose
This work aims to provide an asynchronous \emph{context} to solve the most common problems and encountered needs when coding an asynchronous program. This \emph{context} includes support for local values definition, asynchronous error catching, hooks into the asynchronous executions and primitives to build specialized features on asynchronous transitions.
\\
\\
%method
The first step consits in analysing the existing frameworks for asynchronous execution to determine the environements in which the code has to work.
Then, a study of encountered challenges with asynchronous programming leads to a general solution, able to support building of refined behaviors.
Finally the implementation is integrated and tested on a real-world execution framework.
\\
\\
%scope
The developed solution addresses asynchrony concerns, but not concurrency.
It takes inspiration from the \zonejs\ and \zonedrt\ frameworks and build a similar concept for Java. It implements required functionalites and specifies how to incorporate it into execution frameworks. \vertx\ is used as case study to show concrete use cases and how the integration is realized.
